## Welcome to The Quazer Candidate Challenge!  Congrats making it to this stage...

So here is the challenge; you will be taking one of our API endpoints and will have to create a small application that will display a list and within the list item we would like to see the foollowing info: A channel image and title. When the user clicks on the list item you the user should be taken to a screen/view that will display details about that particular channel. The channel details page should consist of at least the following info: channel number, description, images, and title. It will be up to you to use your descretion to how you would like your app to look like. 

So to reiterate the Challenge:
- a list with channels, and in the item should be an image and title.
- a details page with the follow: channel number, description, images, and title.
